2 player game<br />
Two players start out as different shapes but of the same size. The purpose of the game is to eat as many other small shapes (spawned at random from the edges of the screen) of the same design as possible before the timer starts. If a player accidentally eats a shape of his/her opponent's design, the player decreases in size, whereas eating shapes of his/her same design increases his/her size. Once the timer starts, the players can attempt to eat each other, which is only possible if a player is larger than his/her opponent.<br />
It is possible to speed up while chasing the other player, with the drawback that you begin losing size. However, by speeding up, you can also drop smaller shapes of your same design, which you can retrace through to form connecting lines (this connects any gaps left in between the shapes you dropped). You cannot draw lines while in speeding mode. Thus, by intentionally speeding up and then slowing down to double back over the path you traced, you can form barriers to trap your opponent with.<br />
To differentiate the players from the spawned shapes of similar design to them, the actual players are colored, while the spawned shapes remain white. When the player speeds up and drops shapes, those shapes remain the player's color. If the opponent collides with those shapes, the opponent is blocked (but does not decrease in size).
