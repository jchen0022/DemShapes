2 player game
Two players start out as different shapes but of the same size. The purpose of the game is to eat as many other small shapes (spawned at random from the edges of the screen) of the same design as possible before the timer starts. Once the timer starts, the players can attempt to eat each other, which is only possible if a player is larger than his/her opponent.
